      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project involved making real-life observations and constructing
        unbiased interviews in public, then illustrating user needs and
        experiences based on empirical observations through personas and
        storyboarding. I created engaging narratives that demonstrate the user
        journey end-to-end and the goals and characteristics of the depicted
        persona.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal was to understand user needs and pain points when interacting
        with the coffee machine.

      <h2>The Interface</h2>
      <p>
        I selected a coffee machine located in the lobby of the John D.
        Rockefeller, Jr. Library. This coffee machine has an interative screen
        that allows users to select from a variety of drinks, as well as a
        dispenser and payment system.

        <h3>Interface Description</h3>
        <p>
          The coffee machine features a touchscreen display for selecting drink
          options, a card reader for payment as well as a seperate payment
          terminal for cash and cards, and a drink dispensing area. The
          interface aims to solve the problem of getting coffee in an efficient
          way without making it yourself at home. The main components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Touchscreen Display:</strong> Shows menu options for various
            drink types and allows customization
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Card Reader:</strong> Accepts credit/debit cards and tap pay
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Terminal:</strong> Accepts bills, swipe cards, chip
            cards, and tap pay
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drink Dispensing Area:</strong> Dispenses the drink for the
            user to take
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility Features:</strong> Two flag logos at the
            bottom left of the screen allow users to select their drink in two
            other languages
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Observations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most users didn't browse, instead immediately selecting their choice
          </li>
          <li>Most users selected something from the first screen of drinks</li>
          <li>
            Users completed transitions with minimal time spent reading
            on-screen instructions
          </li>
          <li>
            Several users appeared confused about when to pay versus when to
            select their drink
          </li>
          <li>
            Users often looked around the machine when waiting for their drink
            to be dispensed
          </li>
          <li>
            Some users expressed uncertainty about the difference between
            similar drink options
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple users checked their payment cards multiple times before

            machine?
          </li>
          <li>
            Was there anything about the interface that was unclear or

      <h3>Interview Summaries</h3>
      <div class="interview-response">
        <h4>User 1</h4>
        <p>
          User 1 expressed frequent confusion surrounding topics such as when
          the cup will dispense, when to pay, and the difference between various
          drinks. On the topic of the cup dispensing, they said, "You click the
          thing you're gonna select and then nothing happens then randomly it
          comes out." This user found there to be a lack of instructions as
          well, and thought additional descriptions would be beneficial.
          Expressed stress surrounding the payment, as to when it should happen
          and if it succeeded, and said they would keep using the machine as
          they like the hot chocolate, even though it burns their mouth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="interview-response">
        <h4>User 2</h4>
        <p>
          User 2 doesn't like the futuristic and modern model of the machine.
          Expressed annoyance towards an "error message that's been there since
          last year." Also found the "bring your own cup" feature confusing,
          stating that they didn't know how to do that. Besides that finds the
          machine easy to use because he's memorized the UI and knows how to get
          to his drink. Would continue to use it because it's the only option,
          but said about the initial screen: "we don't need all of this, we
          don't need the touch to start, we just need to pick our drinks."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="interview-response">
        <h4>User 3</h4>
        <p>
          Found the overall experience simple. Said it was easy to complete
          their purchase, and that there's a quick route from choosing their
          drink to paying for it. Found the milk size display confusing, but
          otherways said the machine was quick, price is okay, and it's pretty
          easy to use.

        </div>

        <p>
          Emerson is a 22-year-old junior in college who likes grabbing coffee
          from the machine on his way to class. He visits the library multiple
          times a week and uses the coffee machine almost every time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Interface Problems:</strong> Emerson finds the interface
          unnecessarily complex for his routine order. He dislikes having to
          navigate through multiple screens for a drink he orders almost daily.
          The lack of a quick-order or favorites feature frustrates him, as does
          waiting for animations between screen transitions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Representation:</strong> Emerson represents frequent users who
          prioritize speed and efficiency over exploration. These users have
          established preferences and want the interface to accommodate their
          routine without unnecessary steps.

          Carly is a freshman in college who's new to campus. She's stressed

        <p>
          <strong>Interface Problems:</strong> Carly is unsure about the
          difference between drink options. She also finds the feedback while
          the machine is brewing insufficient and worries about whether her
          transaction went through. She feels confused as to if she should pay
          or select her drink first.

          <strong>Representation:</strong> Carly represents first-time or
          occasional users who approach the interface with curiosity but also
          caution. These users need clearer guidance and feedback throughout the
          entire process.

            Once his payment goes through, a "Make My Drink" button appears
            which Emerson presses before it finishes animating into place. He
            wonders why he needs to press that after paying already anyway.

            The screen doesn't change, but the machine begins to make noise and
            dispense Emerson's drink. Emerson gets on his phone while he waits.

            The moment the machine beeps to signal completion, Emerson carefuly
            grabs his drink (to avoid burning his hands), and marches off to
            class.

      <h2>Reflection & Insights</h2>

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
          Through this study, I gained insights into how different users
          interact with the same machines--in this example, the library's coffee
          machine. There are very sharp contrasts between the habits of certain
          users. For example, users such as the Efficient Emerson persona barely
          look at the interface and just want their coffee. On the other hand,
          users such as Confused Carly are looking for a little more guidance
          and reassurance throughout the process
        </p>

        <p>
          Interacting and communicating with these types of users (and other
          types) revealed a couple pain points:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor location choice for information</strong> - Even though
            there were status updates, users feel as though they're not there
            since they're in the top right corner of the screen, outside of the
            natural line of sight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of drink descriptions</strong> - Users expressed
            confusion about the differences between similar-sounding options
            like "hot chocolate" versus "creamy hot chocolate," and mentioned
            that it would be nice to have distinguishing descriptions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unclear payment flow</strong> - Some users were uncertain
            whether to select their drink first or pay first
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not enough feedback/updates</strong> - While the card reader
            states that the transaction went through, there's no other
            indication on the screen that one is processing or going through,
            potentially confusing readers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inefficient for regulars</strong> - Frequent users were
            bored of going through same screens repeatedly for drinks they order
            many times
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confusing cup options</strong> - The interface sometimes
            mentions bringing your own cup but didn't clearly explain how to do
            so
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Based on these findings, several specific improvements could enhance
          the interface:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Add a "Quick Order" feature that would allow regular users to bypass
            multiple screens
          </li>
          <li>
            Include clear descriptions for each drink option to help users
            understand the differences, including ingredients and caloric
            content for those with dietary restrictions
          </li>
          <li>
            Streamline the payment process with clearer prompts about when and
            how to pay
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide cleare feedback during payment processing and drink
            dispensing with visual and audio cues
          </li>
          <li>Remove the initial welcome screen</li>
          <li>Add clear instructions for the "bring your own cup" option</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This project reinforced the importance of observing users in their
          natural environment rather than relying on assumptions. Even with just
          three users, clear patterns emerged showing how a seemingly simple
          interface needs to accommodate vastly different needs—from the
          efficiency-focused student who wants minimal interaction to the
          cautious user who needs reassurance throughout the process.
